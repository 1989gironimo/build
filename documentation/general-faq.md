# Why there are more download options?

**Debian Wheezy** with kernel 3.4.x, which is usually latest full featured, is recommended download. **Itâ€™s rock stable**, most tested and supported. **Jessie and Ubuntu Trusty** is for people who wants to go with the flow. Both should be fully operational but not recommended for beginners and/or services deployment. Each image can have some extra downloads:

- **(M)** means mirror download 
- **(R)** means root file system changes. Sometimes you need to download and install this file too.


# How to prepare SD card?

Unzipped RAW images can be written with supplied imagewriter.exe on Windows XP/2003/Win7 or with DD command in Linux/Mac:

	dd bs=1M if=filename.raw of=/dev/sdx

(/dev/sdx = your sd card device)

# How to login? 

Login as **root** and use password **1234**. You will be prompted to change this password at first login. This is the only pre-installed user.

# How to add users?

To create a normal user do this:

    adduser FooBar

Put user to sudo group:

    usermod -aG sudo FooBar

# How to customize keyboard, time zone, ... ?

keyboard: 

	dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration
	
system language: 

	dpkg-reconfigure locales

time zone: 

	dpkg-reconfigure tzdata
	
screen resolution - change it + reboot: 

	nano /boot/boot.cmd 
	mkimage -C none -A arm -T script -d /boot/boot.cmd /boot/boot.scr	

# How to alter CPU frequency?

Some boards allow to adjust CPU speed.

	nano /etc/init.d/cpufrequtils

Alter **min_speed** or **max_speed** variable.

	service cpufrequtils restart

# How to upgrade into desktop environment?

simple:

	apt-get -y install xorg lightdm xfce4 xfce4-goodies tango-icon-theme gnome-icon-theme
	reboot

full featured:
	
	apt-get -y install xorg mate-desktop-environment-extras
	reboot

# How to toggle boot output?
Edit and change boot parameters in /boot/boot.cmd:

    - console=ttyS0,115200
    + console=tty1

and convert it to boot.scr with this command:

	mkimage -C none -A arm -T script -d /boot/boot.cmd /boot/boot.scr

Reboot.

# How to install to NAND, SATA & USB?

![Installer](http://www.igorpecovnik.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/sata-installer.png)

Required condition:

 * Kernel 3.4.x (some newer kernels might work too)
 * NAND, SATA or USB storage
 * a partitioned SATA storage
 * booted Debian from SD-Card
 * Login as root

Start the install script: 

    cd /root
    ./nand-sata-install

and follow the guide.

# How to change network configuration?

There are four predefined configurations, you can find them in those files:

	/etc/network/interfaces.default
	/etc/network/interfaces.hostapd	
	/etc/network/interfaces.bonding
	/etc/network/interfaces.r1

By default **/etc/network/interfaces** is symlinked to **/etc/network/interfaces.default**

1. DEFAULT: your network adapters are connected classical way. 
2. HOSTAPD: your network adapters are bridged together and bridge is connected to the network. This allows you to have your AP connected directly to your router.
3. BONDING: your network adapters are bonded in fail safe / "notebook" way.
4. R1: special configuration for Lamobo R1 / Banana R1.

You can switch configuration with re-linking.

	cd /etc/network
	ln -sf interfaces.x interfaces
(x = default,hostapd,bonding,r1)

Than check / alter your interfaces:

	nano /etc/network/interfaces

# How to setup fixed IP?

By default your main network adapter's IP is assigned by your router DHCP server.

	iface eth0 inet dhcp 

change to - for example:

	iface eth0 inet static
	 	address 192.168.1.100
        netmask 255.255.255.0
		gateway 192.168.1.1

# How to setup wireless access point?

There are two different hostap daemons. One is **default** and the other one is for some **Realtek** wifi cards. Both have their own basic configurations and both are patched to gain maximum performances.

Sources: [https://github.com/igorpecovnik/hostapd](https://github.com/igorpecovnik/hostapd "https://github.com/igorpecovnik/hostapd")

Default binary and configuration location:

	/usr/sbin/hostapd
	/etc/hostapd.conf
	
Realtek binary and configuration location:

	/usr/sbin/hostapd-rt
	/etc/hostapd.conf-rt

Since its hard to define when to use which you always try both combinations in case of troubles. To start AP automatically:

1. Edit /etc/init.d/hostapd and add/alter location of your conf file **DAEMON_CONF=/etc/hostapd.conf** and binary **DAEMON_SBIN=/usr/sbin/hostapd**
2. Link **/etc/network/interfaces.hostapd** to **/etc/network/interfaces**
3. Reboot
4. Predefined network name: "BOARD NAME" password: 12345678
5. To change parameters, edit /etc/hostapd.conf ... BTW: You can get WPA_PSK (the long blob) from wpa_passphrase YOURNAME YOURPASS

# How to connect IR remote?

Required conditions: 

- IR hardware
- loaded driver

Get your [remote configuration](http://lirc.sourceforge.net/remotes/) (lircd.conf) or [learn](http://kodi.wiki/view/HOW-TO:Setup_Lirc#Learning_Commands). You are going to need the list of all possible commands which you can map to your IR remote keys:
	
	irrecord --list-namespace

To start with learning process you need to delete old config:
		
	rm /etc/lircd.conf 

Than start the process with:

	irrecord --driver=default --device=/dev/lirc0 /etc/lircd.conf

And finally start your service when done with learning:

	service lirc start

Test your remote:

	irw /dev/lircd

# How to update kernel?

First you need to download a proper kernel tar pack located at the end of board download section (Kernel, U-boot, DTB). This example is for Cubietruck but it's the same for all other boards - just grab a kernel pack for board of your choice.

	mkdir 3.19.6
	cd 3.19.6
	wget http://mirror.igorpecovnik.com/kernel/3.19.6-cubietruck-next.tar
	tar xvf 3.19.6-cubietruck-next.tar
	dpkg -i *.deb
1. Create some temporary directory
2. Go into it
3. Grab a kernel pack
4. Install all .deb files. If some pack refuses to install use: **--force-all**

Reboot.

# Optional steps if you have your system on NAND?

Your first NAND partition is usually mounted under /boot. In this case all you need to do is:

	mkimage -A arm -O linux -T kernel -C none -a "0x40008000" -e "0x40008000" -n "Linux kernel" -d /boot/zImage /boot/uImage

If you use older image than you might need to mount your first NAND partition (**/dev/nand1**) and copy new uImage there. 

Reboot.

# Optional steps if you update kernel to older SD image?

If you came from image that doesn't have boot scripts (/boot/boot.scr) you will need to create one. 

Create **/boot/boot.cmd** file with this content:
	
	setenv bootargs console=tty1 root=/dev/mmcblk0p1 rootwait consoleblank=0
	if ext4load mmc 0 0x00000000 /boot/.next
	then
	ext4load mmc 0 0x49000000 /boot/dtb/${fdtfile} 	
	ext4load mmc 0 0x46000000 /boot/zImage
	env set fdt_high ffffffff
	bootz 0x46000000 - 0x49000000
	else
	ext4load mmc 0 0x43000000 /boot/script.bin
	ext4load mmc 0 0x48000000 /boot/zImage
	bootz 0x48000000
	fi 
	
and convert it to boot.scr with this command:

	mkimage -C none -A arm -T script -d /boot/boot.cmd /boot/boot.scr

Reboot.

# How to compile my own kernel or SD image?

First you will need to setup development environment. Since there are troubles regarding the proper compiler I suggest you to use proven configuration. This image / kernel was successfully cross-compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS x64. You are going to need [server image](http://releases.ubuntu.com/14.04/) and 15-20G of space. Install only basic system and create this compile call script:

	#!/bin/bash	
	# 
	# 	Edit and execute this script - Ubuntu 14.04 x86/64 recommended

You need to choose few options than wait for a while. When done check:

- **output/choosen-destination-version-distro-kernel-version.zip** = zipped RAW image
- **output/kernel** = complete upgrade pack with kernel, modules, headers, firmware, dtbs
- **output/rootfs** = rootfilesystem cache and upgrades only
- **output/u-boot** = deb packed self installed uboot
